# Hotel Booking Application

This repository contains a hotel booking application that was created around the midpoint of my time doing the MCIT course at UPenn. The application is not related to any MCIT course, it's simply a project that I did in my free time to practice some of the skills that I learned. The application is built in Java and uses a PostgreSQL database. My plan is to create a new frontend using the JavaScript React framework.
