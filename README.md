# Hotel Booking Application

This repository contains a hotel booking application that was created around the midpoint of my time doing the MCIT course at UPenn. The application is not connected to any MCIT course, it's simply a project that I did in my free time to practice some of the skills that I learnt on MCIT. The application is built in Java and uses a PostgreSQL database.

I may build a frontend in JavaScript. However, I may also leave the Swing frontend as is as this repository is intended to show applications that I was building at the midpoint of the course. I may show some of the code in a future video review of MCIT courses. It would be more accurate not to update the application with other technologies that I learnt towards the end of or after MCIT.
